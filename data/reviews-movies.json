			"full_text": "<p>In a Hollywood era dominated by franchises and superheroics, Deadpool made for a refreshing, if imperfect, palette cleanser. It was the X-Men franchise interpreted through the lens of Adult Swim, a passion project for star Ryan Reynolds and director Tim Miller that actually conveyed the passion behind it. Now, two years later with new director David Leitch at the helm, Deadpool 2 (eventually) recaptures the original's manic mix of comedy and action.</p><p>Given its impulsive main character and the loud marketing campaign preceding it, you'd think Deadpool 2 would be more confident about the kind of movie it wants to be. As a whole, it's a better film than the first Deadpool, but it has to work through some kinks before it gets there.</p><p>Things start off with a typically Deadpool-y montage of what he's been up to since the first film. But a jarring early incident buries the movie in a hole it spends way too long digging itself out of, and the tone it temporarily sets fails to mesh with a cast of characters that revel in ultraviolence, adolescent profanity and an extended joke about prepubescent appendages.</p><p>Yes, Deadpool 2 swiftly pokes fun at the event in a lengthy title sequence that painfully drives those jokes into the ground, but that doesn't make up for the narrative vacuum the movie struggles to compensate for. The goal of giving Deadpool 2 a tragic heart is noble, but the execution is lacking.</p><p>After that rocky introduction, there's melodrama. Self-discovery. On-the-nose trippy sequences. A prison ripped straight out of Face/Off. Some X-Men. Josh Brolin skulking in the background as telekinetic time-traveling super-soldier Cable. What could be the last time you see TJ Miller in a Deadpool movie. By the time all the pieces are in order, you're left tapping the theater seat waiting for things to happen instead of being about to happen. Sad Deadpool and plot setup have their places, but both outstay their welcome.</p><p>To avoid spoilers, here's the stage that's set after Deadpool's done moping. Laid low by dramatic circumstances, Deadpool has to rediscover his resolve and learn what it's like to be part of a family. To do so, he has to rescue the angsty teen mutant Russell Collins (Julian Dennison) that could have a pretty serious impact on the future. Cable brought himself from a potential future to resolve the Russell situation in his own way, and conflict, comedy and self-referential winks ensue.</p><p>Where Thanos struggles with his relationship to his daughter through interactions with her and decisions he makes through the film, Cable carries a teddy bear. And despite the movie's warning, you should look up Cable's ludicrous backstory. Knowing the ins and outs of the X-Men's convoluted history is essential for getting the most out of some of Deadpool 2's sharpest jokes and references. There are plenty of nods to jokes X-fans have been sharing for years. And yes, that includes some jokes at Deadpool creator Rob Liefeld's artistic ... choices.</p><p>One sequence in the middle of the film encapsulates Deadpool 2 at its best. Backed by a squad of fellow mercenaries (and one notable non-mercenary), Deadpool forms X-Force and launches headfirst into rescuing Russell. What ensues is the kind of escalating gag that Deadpool excels at, going in such unexpected and creative directions it makes you wonder why it took so long for a scene of its caliber to actually happen. Leitch knows how to frame action (he did direct the first John Wick) even during the few instances where the limits of his CGI budget fail him.</p><p>From that set piece onward, the film introduces its literal Big Bad Guy and finds its rhythm. Deadpool 2 picks up the pace, ramps up the frequency of its jokes and dials back on the melodrama. Best of all, the supporting cast has more opportunities to interact with each other. Domino, played by an effortlessly cool Zazie Beetz, takes a larger role, serving as a refreshing middle ground between Deadpool's lunacy and Cable's perpetual scowl.</p><p>The script leans harder into jokes that are built up and earned instead of the \"Deadpool says random thing, scene continues.\" And the fights of the first film are topped by such a wide margin it's hard to go back after seeing what Deadpool 2 cooks up. It's easy to forget the first Deadpool basically ended with a sword fight and a brawl. But while the climactic final battle at the end of Deadpool 2 might not be the best superhero fight ever, it's close, and by far a step above the familiar \"heroes fight swarms of minions while a beam shoots into the sky.\"</p>",

			"full_text": "<p>As a rule, any marriage in which one partner can willingly cry out to the other, \"Trampoline me!,\" inspires only envy and awe. In the heat of the action, that is what Mr. Incredible says to Mrs. Incredible, in \"Incredibles 2,\" and I’m disappointed to report that the action in question is merely the manic pursuit of a gigantic drill that is whirring through a crowded city and demolishing everything in its path, rather than a lazy afternoon in the marital boudoir with the door discreetly shut.</p><p>The reason that Mrs. Incredible—Helen to her friends—can love, cherish, and trampoline her husband, the brawny Bob, is because she is also, praise the Lord, Elastigirl. He is strong and she is stretchy; he is no more vexed by being pummelled by rocks than he would be by stubbing his toe, and she can flatten herself into a human pancake or, though normally waspish of waist, spread her torso into a handy parachute. In short, the perfect couple. It is fourteen years, would you believe, since we first made their acquaintance, in \"The Incredibles,\" one of the high spots in the history of Pixar, and now the writer and director of that delectable movie, Brad Bird, has returned with a second helping.</p><p>It begins pretty much where the previous one left off, as if the characters had merely been staying put and holding their breath. Their voices, too, are mostly unchanged: Holly Hunter is still the shrewd and resourceful Helen, Craig T. Nelson is still Bob, with his lumbering sigh, and Sarah Vowell, as their daughter Violet, still provides the pitch and yaw of adolescent speech—now tetchy, now timid, but touched here and there with a determination that might just save the day. (Her specialty is to vanish at will, or to shield herself inside an invincible bubble: every teen-ager’s dream.) Only the sound of the elder son, the high-speed Dash, has been updated; his lines are now spoken, I rejoice to say, by a young actor named Huckleberry Milner. It’s ideal for Dash, whose permanent aim is to race around the river bend, as it were, and see what adventures await.</p><p>There is also Jack-Jack, the baby, about whom (and this is a typically smart piece of narrative engineering from Bird) we already know more than his family does. That’s because they weren’t watching when, at the end of \"The Incredibles,\" he burst into flames—all too much for the baddie who was trying to abduct him at the time, and who found him too hot to handle. It takes the rest of the Incredibles more than half the film to discover that their youngest member is super-powered, too, although whether Jack-Jack is possessed of or by his powers is open to debate. These appear to be endless. He can, when irate, become an empurpled and diabolical troll; his sneezes rocket him vertically through the ceiling; his eyes fire lasers, either in a steady beam or, if required, in pulsing jets; and he can go forth and multiply, producing an instant brood of himself, with an audible pop, not unlike Olaf, the auto-dismantling snowman, in Disney’s \"Frozen.\" There’s even a scene in which Jack-Jack swells into a bulbous mega-baby, for no perceptible reason. At this point, to my horror, I began to have doubts about the film.</p><p>These did not come easily. My attitude to \"The Incredibles,\" upon its release, resembled that of an ancient Egyptian toward the sun god, Ra, and it has barely dimmed in the interim. It was with fear and trembling, therefore, that I looked ahead to the second coming. Would Bird be able to sustain the fast, angular moves of the first—the near-geometric nicety with which Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), Bob’s skating super-pal, charted his ice-cool vectors across the screen? And would he still sport his clinging turtleneck? In terms of design, would the new movie maintain the dazzling concatenation of the first, in which the space-age made beautiful music with the retro? Would the sequel, like the original, so bewitch us with its levity, its easeful spin, and the snap of its colors that we might begin to imagine, for a couple of hours, what it would feel like to live inside an Alexander Calder mobile?</p><p>You bet. Once Michael Giacchino’s score—his best and most excitable—was up and running, I was happy and hooked. (Make sure you stick around for the whole of the final credits, in the course of which he spoils us with riff after riff, including one that gets deep, and deeper still, into the Frozone groove.) And, once Helen was called upon to halt a runaway monorail, I was able to relax, in the confidence that \"Incredibles 2,\" like all the best Pixar projects, had been constructed with the customary flair and care. Let’s face it: life without a monorail, in movies like these, would be frankly unendurable. The vision that they project, bright with kinetic wit, is also shaded, here and there, with historical regret. They show us what the past hoped the future might be.</p><p>That is why the old-style telephones, with receivers, or the shop window filled with boxy brown televisions can coexist with the scarlet electric motorbike that Helen mounts, or the airplane that unlocks from the body of a hydrofoil and takes wing. And that is why the Incredibles start the film in a motel room, eating Chinese takeout, and are soon transplanted into a cavernous lair that juts out from a sylvan hillside. It is graced by the ghosts not only of Frank Lloyd Wright but of Cary Grant, too, who clung to a similar structure, in \"North by Northwest,\" and listened to Martin Landau and James Mason enjoy a quiet word. What Bird has managed to do, with a couple of kids’ cartoons, is to revive the modernist thrill.</p><p>Second time around, we get the sexual politics to match. Things are tough for the Incredibles, as the story kicks off, with superheroes fallen from public favor. (They make too much mess, apparently, leaving the city with an unpopular repair bill. Was the same sort of argument not aired in \"Spider-Man: Homecoming,\" last year?) The corollary, as Bob and Helen agree, is that, \"One of us has to get a job.\" Guess who. Smarter, smaller, more rubbery, and guaranteed to cause less collateral damage, Helen is the obvious choice. She is picked by Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk), a gratingly upbeat tech magnate, and his more languid sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener) to battle crime, and, no less crucial, to be seen to battle crime. Innumerable cameras, at his command, will insure that Helen’s exploits become common knowledge of the most gratifying type. So that’s what superheroes were lacking: good P.R.</p><p>Bob, in the meantime, stays home with the kids. You can predict what’s going to happen, but it’s fun, nonetheless, to witness the curve of his learning, as he finds out, to his exhausting cost, that childcare is not the breeze that he and many other men presume. So multifarious are its demands, indeed, that only by being as flexible as his wife could he fulfill them all. He must master afresh the delights of math. He must read supposedly soporific books to an infant who gives every sign of eternal wakefulness. He must try not to implode when his grouchy daughter instructs him to go away. He must become, in short, Elastiboy. Fat chance.</p><p>Helen has larger troubles to contend with, namely the presence of a darksome being called the Screenslaver, whose plan is to transform upstanding citizens into staring zombies by hypnosis, and who seems, from his vocabulary, to have swallowed his regulation dose of Noam Chomsky, Jean Baudrillard, and other prophets of our alienated gloom. (\"You don’t talk, you watch talk shows,\" and so on.) Also on hand is a bunch of other superheroes, whom Winston wants to beckon out of semi-retirement, but who lack the charm—and the forthrightness—of Helen, Bob, and the gang. Thus, we are introduced to figures such as Void, Screech, and the indelicate Reflux, whose party trick is to disgorge what can only be construed as a lava barf. What’s the deal here? Observing these dorky mutants, I wondered whether Bird, the most mischievous of Pixar’s directors, has taken the opportunity both to match and to mock the \"X-Men\" saga, with its frowning array of the strangely gifted. Not before time. In the same vein, the merry havoc on the secret island in \"The Incredibles\" made it more difficult than ever to take seriously those eruptive scenes in which James Bond confronts his latest nemesis and, for good measure, blows shit up.</p><p>Not that \"Incredibles 2\" is solemnity-free. There are quite a few discussions of what it means to be heroic, to be married, to share responsibilities, and so forth, and we are asked to recall an era in which people \"would do something good just because it’s right.\" That tint of ethical nostalgia is reminiscent of Spielberg, in his \"Bridge of Spies\" mode, and it consorts neatly with the decor of the new film. Yet I was reminded, in the process, of the cultural events that have intervened between \"The Incredibles\" and its equally zippy successor. First came \"Mad Men,\" which boasted its own range of period accoutrements, but which choked our yearning for the suits, the smokes, the frocks, the whiskey tumblers, the Sinatra albums, and the rest of the gear by reminding us of the society that they once adorned, with its oppressions both casual and institutional, and its half-concealed despairs. \"Incredibles 2\" can scarcely own up to those, not with young children in the audience, but what it can do, even without stating the dilemma, is to offer a solution. Hence the sight of Helen, accelerating off to work, away from her justly abandoned man, in her black mask, her long tall boots, and her empowering outfit, as tight as a second skin.</p><p>Which bring us to the other event. Take your seat at any early-evening screening of \"Incredibles 2\" in the coming days, listen carefully, and you may just hear a shifty sound, as of parents squirming awkwardly beside their enraptured offspring. And why, kids? Because Mommy just leaned over to Daddy and whispered, \"Is it just me, or does Mrs. Incredible kind of look like Anastasia in ‘Fifty Shades of Grey?’ You know, the girl in the Red Room, with the whips and all?\" And Daddy just rested his cooling soda firmly in his lap and, like Mr. Incredible, tried very hard to think of algebra. As for how Daddy will react later on, during the scene in which Helen and the husky-voiced Evelyn unwind and simply talk, woman to woman, I hate to think, but watch out for flying popcorn.</p><p>So, with all these joys in attendance, how come \"Incredibles 2\" delivers less of a punch than we received fourteen years ago? Maybe that was bound to be the case. The second punch may be thrown with equal panache, but it can never, by definition, recapture the sheer visual shock of the first. The gags that surprised us, initially, now seem to slot into place, and most of the major laughs, when I saw the movie, were sprung by Jack-Jack. Some of them are fairly basic, as when he tips his bowl of food over his head, and others are more sophisticated, as when Edna, the tiny and ferocious couturière from \"The Incredibles,\" (voiced again by Bird), is invited to be his babysitter. I would say that they get along like a house on fire, but, in Jack-Jack’s case, the simile may be unwise.</p><p>There remains, however, the question of those multiple talents that he sprouts in the course of the film. Once they are revealed to his proud mother, of course, she pronounces him \"polymorphous,\" but is that a virtue that we seek, or need, in this gorgeously animated world? Does it not smack of trying a little too hard? In principle, limitless comedy sounds like a blast, but in practice we need a clear and flint-like sense of the limits, physical or otherwise, against which the characters strike if the jokes are to be sparked. If Buzz Lightyear really could fly as well as he claimed to do, there would be no pathos to his bluster; as it is, he goes to finity, but not beyond. Likewise, if Helen were as polymorphous as her youngest son, and capable of existing in two places at once, her whole work-life balance would have been settled from the start, and we would have no movie. And that would be a disaster.</p><p>Helen is the undoubted star of \"Incredibles 2,\" precisely because she is forever torn in her obligations, and because not even she, Elastigirl, can mend the tear. \"To help my family I gotta leave it, to fix the law I gotta break it,\" she says, summing up the super-paradox of her life. To that end, she is content, of her own free will, to undergo what Wile E. Coyote, or the Tom of \"Tom and Jerry,\" suffered as constant punishment. She is painlessly pulled, thinned out, compressed, billowed, and yes, deployed as a trampoline. The things we do for love.</p>",

			"full_text": "<p>Steven Spielberg's new film adaptation of Ready Player One prominently features that same car, but in a context that improves it immensely. Spielberg doesn't have Wade talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references. He just slaps the car down in the middle of a tremendous early action scene, where it's prominent, distinctive, and memorable. Fans who want the full nostalgia trip, who want to wring every Easter egg out of the experience, will eventually be able to pause the movie and frame-by-frame through it, looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. But in the middle of the action, even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. It's not a citation or a list. It's an effortless, integrated piece of the action.</p><p>That dynamic stretches throughout Ready Player One, scripted by Cline and X-Men: The Last Stand writer Zak Penn, and directed by Spielberg as a whiplash-fast tear through a world-spanning, all-encompassing video game. The story, which mostly takes place in the virtual-reality world called The OASIS, rarely slows down enough to explain the references, or geek out over them the way the book does. It's still a visual festival of '80s culture that sometimes hinges significant jokes on the assumption that the audience knows the filmography of Robert Zemeckis, or will chortle over a reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. But the film improves significantly on the book by prioritizing the story over the signifiers. The hardcore pop-culture crowd that is this movie's ultimate intended audience will have plenty to pore over and pick apart in this film. But the story moves briskly enough, and with enough giant-sized, screen-friendly excitement that it doesn't feel like it's aimed solely and specifically at them.</p><p>Some of that speed comes at the expense of artistry. Ready Player One opens by laboriously climbing a mountain of voiceover, explaining the setting: the year is 2045, and the world is terrible. Most people live in depressing poverty, and spend as much time as possible jacked into the fantasy world of the OASIS. There, they can be and do anything they want, or at least anything they can afford to buy with coins won in the universe's eternally running video game arenas. The OASIS was created by reclusive genius James Halliday (Bridge of Spies' Mark Rylance), who packed it with his own favorite culture. When he died, he created a three-part quest within the world, linked to his favorite films and games, but also tied to his own past regrets and frustrations. Whoever finds the three keys he's hidden within the game world, and the ultimate Easter egg they unlock, will get full control of OASIS and Halliday's vast fortune.</p>",

But more often than not, the studio's films are primarily concerned with keeping all the narrative plates spinning on the long march toward the Thanos showdown that will finally start in Avengers: Infinity War.</p><p>Ryan Coogler's Black Panther is different. Not only is it a long-overdue embrace of diversity and representation, it's a film that actually has something to say - and it's able to do so without stepping away from the superhero dynamics that make the larger franchise work. It's gripping, funny, and full of spectacle, but it also feels like a turning point, one where the studio has finally recognized that its movies can be about more than just selling the next installment. In the process, the studio has ended up with one of the most enthralling entries in its entire universe.</p><p>Black Panther picks up in the aftermath of Captain America: Civil War, where audiences were first introduced to Chadwick Boseman's Prince T'Challa and his superhero alter ego Black Panther. In the wake of his father's death, T'Challa returns home to the country of Wakanda, where he will take his father's place as king. Wakanda is a mystery to the outside world. It's an incredibly advanced country filled with fantastic technological wizardry, but those advancements come courtesy of vibranium, a rare ore found almost exclusively in Wakanda. In order to protect its massive store of the substance, Wakanda has pretended to be a primitive nation throughout its history, hiding its advancements from the rest of the world with the aid of a force field.</p>",

These are movies that turn your gaze into near-touch, inviting you to see and almost caress their sun-warmed bodies.",
			"full_text": "<p>You don't just watch Luca Guadagnino's movies, you swoon into them. His best-known titles, 'I Am Love' and 'A Bigger Splash,' feature beautiful people with impeccable taste experiencing haute-bourgeois life intensely. Passion and drama upend those lives, but what's most striking about these movies is their extraordinary palpable quality. In Mr. Guadagnino's work, passion and drama are expressed in words, deeds and surging music but also in the vibrant, visceral textures that envelop his characters - the cool marble, succulent fruit, shadow and light, sheens of sweat. These are movies that turn your gaze into near-touch, inviting you to see and almost caress their sun-warmed bodies.</p><p>Mr. Guadagnino's latest, 'Call Me by Your Name,' is another ravishment of the senses, though this time there's a strong narrative tethering all the churning feelings and sensuous surfaces. Like the 2007 novel by André Aciman on which it's based, the story turns on an affair between Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), a coltish 17-year-old American-Italian, and Oliver (Armie Hammer), an American in his 20s. Elio lives with his father (a tremendous Michael Stuhlbarg) and mother (Amira Casar) in a villa in northern Italy. Each summer the father, a professor of Greco-Roman culture, invites a student to work with him and stay with his family; this year it's Oliver who moves in.</p><p>Elio and Oliver's affair begins slowly with each circling the other at a distance, conveying the kind of nonchalance that's a shield for interest. Oliver proves far better at this part of the game; he knows more than to look too long and too hard. Elio's furtive, ducking glances, by contrast, tend to linger, hovering in the air like questions. He's increasingly curious about this new guest, but soon inexplicably (to Elio, at least) irked by him as well, leading Elio to complain to his parents about Oliver's standard signoff ('later'). But when Elio scribbles a private rebuke in a notebook, chastising himself for responding harshly toward Oliver, it's as if he were writing an apologetic love letter.</p>",

			"full_text": "<p>More than 50 years since it first captured the hearts and expanded the minds of bookish young misfits, dreamers and in-betweeners around the world, \"A Wrinkle in Time,\" Madeleine L'Engle's 1962 coming-of-age-as-interdimensional-odyssey novel, has finally materialized in theaters. The director Ava DuVernay's adaptation, of a fantastical and cerebral story that many readers over the years had deemed unfilmable is one of the most anticipated movie events of the year - and one of the most polarizing.</p><p>The story begins with Meg Murry (Storm Reid) and her six-year-old adopted brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), and their scientist mother Kate (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) in a state of mourning over the disappearance of the family patriarch, Alex Murry (Chris Pine). The family was baffled by his sudden vanishing, but it turns out to be connected to his research (with Kate) into tesseracts, a phenomenon that allows for the folding of space and time. With help from three magical beings, the goofball Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), the regal Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey) and the wise Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), the kids leave their world to find Alex, bringing Meg's crush object, Levi Miller's Calvin O'Keefe, along with them. As they travel to a series of galactic locales to free Alex from the grip of dark forces, young Charles Wallace, a prodigy who at times evokes that little kid from \"Looper\" with the thundercloud eyes, undergoes a terrifying change. </p><p>The film's tone is so radically earnest at certain points-particularly when it's dealing with loss and disappointment-that the movie's logo could be a gigantic ear of corn. In its multicultural casting, its child-centric story, and its emphasis on the validity of feelings, it's so different from every other recent big-budget live-action fantasy (superhero films included) that its very existence amounts to a contrarian statement. Much of the emotional heavy lifting is done by the daughter-father team of Reid and Pine. Pine has stealthily become one of the most versatile leading men in American movies, and one of the few who can channel that old-fashioned, George-Bailey-having-a-breakdown-at-the-bar brand of emotionally vulnerable masculinity without seeming as if he's just doing a bit. Like the rest of the core cast, he's doing old-movie style, just-plant-your-feet-and-say-the-lines acting that seems to be pretending that the Method never happened. Reid in particular is quite good at this; some of the notes she strikes early on reminded me of Elizabeth Taylor in \"National Velvet\" in their near-theatricality, but in a scene with Pine near the end, the facade drops, and it's devastating. You think about how strong this girl had to pretend to be, how impervious to pain, and how it was all for show: a survival mechanism.</p>",

There's the nerdy Vice Principal, the bacchanalian high school party, supportive yet somewhat clueless parents, witty voiceover from the protagonist, public declarations of love in front of the whole school, all held together by a stream of catchy pop tunes. But \"Love, Simon\"'s use of these cliches represents a huge first, because it is the story of a young closeted gay kid's difficult and often humorous march towards coming out. Director Greg Berlanti, who has helmed a string of hit television shows as producer and writer, uses the familiar teenage romance genre to tell an LGBTQ story, and in so doing makes these tropes feel fresh, fun, entertaining. Based on Becky Albertalli's YA novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, \"Love, Simon\" is a radically inclusive act.</p><p>As Simon (Nick Robinson) tells us in his opening voiceover, he lives a normal life \"just like you.\" He lives in a nice house, has two supportive parents (Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel) and a young sister obsessed with \"Top Chef\" (Talitha Eliana Bateman). He's a good student and participates in the Drama Club. His best friends are Leah (Katherine Langford), Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) and Abby (Alexandra Shipp). Nothing is wrong, except, as Simon says in voiceover, \"I have a huge-ass secret.\" His secret is he is gay. He is pretty sure his parents would be fine with it and his friends would be okay too. He is afraid, instead, of how it will change everything, how people might perceive him differently. He also resents having to \"come out\" at all (which leads to a very funny sequence imagining kids having to come out as heterosexual to their devastated sobbing parents). Why is \"straight the default,\" he asks.</p><p>When someone with the alias \"Blue\" writes a post on a popular local message board about being afraid to come out as gay, Simon reaches out privately, using the alias \"Jacques.\" The two kids start a correspondence, hesitant at first and then increasing in intensity. The identity of \"Blue\" is the cliffhanger of \"Love, Simon,\" and Berlanti has a lot of fun keeping us in suspense. There are many potential candidates, and as Simon drifts from one to the other, wondering, \"Are you Blue? Are you?\" It could be any one of them. One of the beautiful aspects of \"Love, Simon\" is that the intimacy blossoming between the two characters is based on how much they come to care about each other, how much they support one another's journey. The romantic feelings come out of a soul and heart connection.</p>",

			"full_text": "<p>Based on the 2013 video game, and featuring Alicia Vikanderas the latest incarnation of a character who's been around for 22 years, \"Tomb Raider\" surprisingly plays like a throwback to the classic late-'80s/early '90s era of action filmmaking, represented by the likes of \"Cliffhanger,\" \"The Last of the Mohicans,\" the first couple of Indiana Jones films, and Jackie Chan's \"Armour of God\" series. From the animated prologue, wherein the title character's archeologist father, Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), tells of an ancient, cursed tomb supposedly containing the all-powerful, weaponizable remains of the Japanese shaman queen Himiko, through its gracefully executed series of chases and emotional moments, to its finale set on a Pacific island riddled with booby-trapped ruins, \"Tomb Raider\" is much better and more original than anyone could have expected.</p><p>Although it borrows from the game (and, partially, its sequel) for structure and most of its key action sequences, \"Tomb Raider\" never feels like a pointless companion piece to a work that was created for a different medium. I've never played the game this film is adapting, but I had a great time watching the movie it inspired, thanks mainly to the direction; the stunt choreography, which leans on real performers and props whenever it makes sense to; the emphasis on problem-solving one's way out of tight situations; and most of all, the actors, who flesh out archetypal characters who might have seemed cliched or merely flat on the page, and make them as real as they can, considering what sort of movie they're in.</p><p>First among equals is Alicia Vikander with her faintly regal bearing. She's correctly cast as a woman who's literally to-the-manor-born, but the humility and sense of fair play that she exudes makes you like rather than resent the character. More importantly, though, she's an action hero par excellence. Carved like a wood sculpture, and seemingly bereft of body fat, Vikander hurls herself into the film's action sequences. She makes you feel the physicality of this intensely visceral performance, letting out a high-pitched grunt of rage or pain when Lara crashes into a wall or gets slammed on the ground by a brawny foe, and letting sparks of fury flash in her eyes as Lara delivers a coup-de-grace.</p>",
