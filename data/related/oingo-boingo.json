			"full_text": "<p>Dead Man's Party is the fifth album by American new wave band Oingo Boingo, released in 1985. The album cover art is an homage to the Mexican holiday Día de Muertos.</p><p>The album features a different musical style than the band's previous releases, with a more pop-friendly production sound and dance arrangements.</p><p>Elfman stated that he wrote the album's lead single, \"Weird Science,\" spontaneously in his car, after receiving a call from director John Hughes about composing a song for his upcoming film of the same name. The song went on to become the band's most commercially successful single, which Elfman later regretted, as he believed it \"just didn't feel like it was really a part of [the band's] repertoire.\"</p><h3>In film and television</h3><p>\"Just Another Day\" was featured as the opening theme for the 1985 film That Was Then... This Is Now. It also appears in season 2, episode 1 of the Netflix series Stranger Things, though somewhat anachronistically, as the episode takes place on October 28, 1984, a full year before the actual release date of the Dead Man's Party album.</p><p>The title track appears in the 1986 film Back to School, wherein the band performs the song live at a party. It also appeared in the Chuck television series, in the episode \"Chuck Versus the Couch Lock.\"</p><p>\"No One Lives Forever\" appears in the 1986 Cannon Group production of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, as well as Casper: A Spirited Beginning, a 1997 direct-to-video release from 20th Century Fox and Saban Entertainment. It was also used as the theme for the October 29, 2010 episode of Rachael Ray.</p><p>The song \"Stay\" became a hit in Brazil and was used as the theme song for the Brazilian Telenovela Top Model, which increased the popularity of the band in that country and resulted in a Brazilian compilation album, Stay. It was also featured in Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut  , as well as in the 2012 Australian film Any Questions for Ben?</p><p>The final track, \"Weird Science,\" was written for the aforementioned John Hughes film of the same name and was used again as the theme to the television series on the USA network.</p>",
