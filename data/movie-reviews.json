Spielberg doesn't have Wade talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references. He just slaps the car down in the middle of a tremendous early action scene, where it's prominent, distinctive, and memorable. Fans who want the full nostalgia trip, who want to wring every Easter egg out of the experience, will eventually be able to pause the movie and frame-by-frame through it, looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. But in the middle of the action, even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. It's not a citation or a list. It's an effortless, integrated piece of the action.",

Spielberg doesn't have Wade talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references. He just slaps the car down in the middle of a tremendous early action scene, where it's prominent, distinctive, and memorable. Fans who want the full nostalgia trip, who want to wring every Easter egg out of the experience, will eventually be able to pause the movie and frame-by-frame through it, looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. But in the middle of the action, even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. It's not a citation or a list. It's an effortless, integrated piece of the action.</p><p>That dynamic stretches throughout Ready Player One, scripted by Cline and X-Men: The Last Stand writer Zak Penn, and directed by Spielberg as a whiplash-fast tear through a world-spanning, all-encompassing video game. The story, which mostly takes place in the virtual-reality world called The OASIS, rarely slows down enough to explain the references, or geek out over them the way the book does. It's still a visual festival of ‘80s culture that sometimes hinges significant jokes on the assumption that the audience knows the filmography of Robert Zemeckis, or will chortle over a reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. But the film improves significantly on the book by prioritizing the story over the signifiers. The hardcore pop-culture crowd that is this movie's ultimate intended audience will have plenty to pore over and pick apart in this film. But the story moves briskly enough, and with enough giant-sized, screen-friendly excitement that it doesn't feel like it's aimed solely and specifically at them.</p><p>Some of that speed comes at the expense of artistry. Ready Player One opens by laboriously climbing a mountain of voiceover, explaining the setting: the year is 2045, and the world is terrible. Most people live in depressing poverty, and spend as much time as possible jacked into the fantasy world of the OASIS. There, they can be and do anything they want, or at least anything they can afford to buy with coins won in the universe's eternally running video game arenas. The OASIS was created by reclusive genius James Halliday (Bridge of Spies' Mark Rylance), who packed it with his own favorite culture. When he died, he created a three-part quest within the world, linked to his favorite films and games, but also tied to his own past regrets and frustrations. Whoever finds the three keys he's hidden within the game world, and the ultimate Easter egg they unlock, will get full control of OASIS and Halliday's vast fortune.</p>",

But more often than not, the studio's films are primarily concerned with keeping all the narrative plates spinning on the long march toward the Thanos showdown that will finally start in Avengers: Infinity War.</p><p>Ryan Coogler's Black Panther is different. Not only is it a long-overdue embrace of diversity and representation, it's a film that actually has something to say — and it's able to do so without stepping away from the superhero dynamics that make the larger franchise work. It's gripping, funny, and full of spectacle, but it also feels like a turning point, one where the studio has finally recognized that its movies can be about more than just selling the next installment. In the process, the studio has ended up with one of the most enthralling entries in its entire universe.</p><p>Black Panther picks up in the aftermath of Captain America: Civil War, where audiences were first introduced to Chadwick Boseman's Prince T'Challa and his superhero alter ego Black Panther. In the wake of his father's death, T'Challa returns home to the country of Wakanda, where he will take his father's place as king. Wakanda is a mystery to the outside world. It's an incredibly advanced country filled with fantastic technological wizardry, but those advancements come courtesy of vibranium, a rare ore found almost exclusively in Wakanda. In order to protect its massive store of the substance, Wakanda has pretended to be a primitive nation throughout its history, hiding its advancements from the rest of the world with the aid of a force field.</p>",

Like the 2007 novel by André Aciman on which it's based, the story turns on an affair between Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), a coltish 17-year-old American-Italian, and Oliver (Armie Hammer), an American in his 20s. Elio lives with his father (a tremendous Michael Stuhlbarg) and mother (Amira Casar) in a villa in northern Italy. Each summer the father, a professor of Greco-Roman culture, invites a student to work with him and stay with his family; this year it's Oliver who moves in.</p><p>Elio and Oliver's affair begins slowly with each circling the other at a distance, conveying the kind of nonchalance that's a shield for interest. Oliver proves far better at this part of the game; he knows more than to look too long and too hard. Elio's furtive, ducking glances, by contrast, tend to linger, hovering in the air like questions. He's increasingly curious about this new guest, but soon inexplicably (to Elio, at least) irked by him as well, leading Elio to complain to his parents about Oliver's standard signoff ('later'). But when Elio scribbles a private rebuke in a notebook, chastising himself for responding harshly toward Oliver, it's as if he were writing an apologetic love letter.</p>",

		"full_text": "<p>More than 50 years since it first captured the hearts and expanded the minds of bookish young misfits, dreamers and in-betweeners around the world, \"A Wrinkle in Time,\" Madeleine L'Engle's 1962 coming-of-age-as-interdimensional-odyssey novel, has finally materialized in theaters. The director Ava DuVernay's adaptation, of a fantastical and cerebral story that many readers over the years had deemed unfilmable is one of the most anticipated movie events of the year - and one of the most polarizing.</p><p>The story begins with Meg Murry (Storm Reid) and her six-year-old adopted brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), and their scientist mother Kate (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) in a state of mourning over the disappearance of the family patriarch, Alex Murry (Chris Pine). The family was baffled by his sudden vanishing, but it turns out to be connected to his research (with Kate) into tesseracts, a phenomenon that allows for the folding of space and time. With help from three magical beings, the goofball Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), the regal Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey) and the wise Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), the kids leave their world to find Alex, bringing Meg's crush object, Levi Miller's Calvin O'Keefe, along with them. As they travel to a series of galactic locales to free Alex from the grip of dark forces, young Charles Wallace, a prodigy who at times evokes that little kid from \"Looper\" with the thundercloud eyes, undergoes a terrifying change. </p><p>The film's tone is so radically earnest at certain points—particularly when it's dealing with loss and disappointment—that the movie's logo could be a gigantic ear of corn. In its multicultural casting, its child-centric story, and its emphasis on the validity of feelings, it's so different from every other recent big-budget live-action fantasy (superhero films included) that its very existence amounts to a contrarian statement. Much of the emotional heavy lifting is done by the daughter-father team of Reid and Pine. Pine has stealthily become one of the most versatile leading men in American movies, and one of the few who can channel that old-fashioned, George-Bailey-having-a-breakdown-at-the-bar brand of emotionally vulnerable masculinity without seeming as if he's just doing a bit. Like the rest of the core cast, he's doing old-movie style, just-plant-your-feet-and-say-the-lines acting that seems to be pretending that the Method never happened. Reid in particular is quite good at this; some of the notes she strikes early on reminded me of Elizabeth Taylor in \"National Velvet\" in their near-theatricality, but in a scene with Pine near the end, the facade drops, and it's devastating. You think about how strong this girl had to pretend to be, how impervious to pain, and how it was all for show: a survival mechanism.</p>",

Based on Becky Albertalli's YA novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, \"Love, Simon\" is a radically inclusive act.</p><p>As Simon (Nick Robinson) tells us in his opening voiceover, he lives a normal life \"just like you.\" He lives in a nice house, has two supportive parents (Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel) and a young sister obsessed with \"Top Chef\" (Talitha Eliana Bateman). He's a good student and participates in the Drama Club. His best friends are Leah (Katherine Langford), Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) and Abby (Alexandra Shipp). Nothing is wrong, except, as Simon says in voiceover, \"I have a huge-ass secret.\" His secret is he is gay. He is pretty sure his parents would be fine with it and his friends would be okay too. He is afraid, instead, of how it will change everything, how people might perceive him differently. He also resents having to \"come out\" at all (which leads to a very funny sequence imagining kids having to come out as heterosexual to their devastated sobbing parents). Why is \"straight the default,\" he asks.</p><p>When someone with the alias \"Blue\" writes a post on a popular local message board about being afraid to come out as gay, Simon reaches out privately, using the alias \"Jacques.\" The two kids start a correspondence, hesitant at first and then increasing in intensity. The identity of \"Blue\" is the cliffhanger of \"Love, Simon,\" and Berlanti has a lot of fun keeping us in suspense. There are many potential candidates, and as Simon drifts from one to the other, wondering, \"Are you Blue? Are you?\" It could be any one of them. One of the beautiful aspects of \"Love, Simon\" is that the intimacy blossoming between the two characters is based on how much they come to care about each other, how much they support one another's journey. The romantic feelings come out of a soul and heart connection.</p>",

I've never played the game this film is adapting, but I had a great time watching the movie it inspired, thanks mainly to the direction; the stunt choreography, which leans on real performers and props whenever it makes sense to; the emphasis on problem-solving one's way out of tight situations; and most of all, the actors, who flesh out archetypal characters who might have seemed cliched or merely flat on the page, and make them as real as they can, considering what sort of movie they're in.</p><p>First among equals is Alicia Vikander with her faintly regal bearing. She's correctly cast as a woman who's literally to-the-manor-born, but the humility and sense of fair play that she exudes makes you like rather than resent the character. More importantly, though, she's an action hero par excellence. Carved like a wood sculpture, and seemingly bereft of body fat, Vikander hurls herself into the film's action sequences. She makes you feel the physicality of this intensely visceral performance, letting out a high-pitched grunt of rage or pain when Lara crashes into a wall or gets slammed on the ground by a brawny foe, and letting sparks of fury flash in her eyes as Lara delivers a coup-de-grace.</p>",
