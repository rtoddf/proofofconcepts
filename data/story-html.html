<p>Georgia finished first in the recruiting rankings in the 2018 class. Expect the Bulldogs to be at the top in 2019, too. DawgNation's Jeff Sentell will answer a Recruiting Question of the Day on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You can ask him your questions on Twitter or the DawgNation Message board forum. Previous QODs can be found on our question of the day archives page.</p><p>Georgia finished first in the recruiting rankings in the 2018 class. Expect the Bulldogs to be at the top in 2019, too. DawgNation's Jeff Sentell will answer a Recruiting Question of the Day on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You can ask him your questions on Twitter or the DawgNation Message board forum. Previous QODs can be found on our question of the day archives page.</p><h3>QUESTION OF THE DAY</h3><p>DawgNation message board user @jinx55 asks: Can you provide your take on what the rest of the 2018 class brings to the team, as guys like Adam Anderson, Chris Smith, Channing Tindall and company arrive in June. Any guys you think will standout or push for positions following what you've seen and heard during the Spring??</p><p>Good question. I kicked around a few ways to share this level of information quickly for a 26-man signing class. To do so, I'll borrow a ratings scale used by NFL.com for its 2018 draft pick evaluations.</p><p>I'll offer just one note of clarification here. It would be very easy to lump a bunch of guys together with so many high-level signees for 2018. Here's my best guess at doing so while trying to add a level of variety.</p><p>A few of the 2018 signees, using James Cook as a perfect example, should be major factors by their junior years, but they are not expected to contribute heavily in 2018.</p><p>That serves as a proper illustration regarding the true intent here to balance short-term value with a long-term projection. Of the 26 signees, it does not seem likely to forecast more than 14-15 of these guys to one day be drafted by NFL teams.</p><ul>
